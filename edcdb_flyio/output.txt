In 1881, Borax was discovered  in Death Valley, California, A team  of 20 mules formed a 100 foot long  team and took 10 days to transport  10 tons of Borax from the remote  mines in Death Valley to the railroad  so it could be boxed and used  in homes all across America, More  than 100 years later, Borax is still  focused on delivering a natural  clean for homes everywhere
