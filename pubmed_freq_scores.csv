They can cause damage to organs, including the heart, brain and muscle, by various mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, abnormal energy metabolism, or genetic mutations. Identifying and detecting pathophysiological alterations in mitochondria is the principal means of studying mitochondrial abnormalities. The present study reviewed methods in mitochondrial research and focused on three aspects: Mitochondrial extraction and purification, morphology and structure and function. In addition to classical methods, such as electron microscopy and mitochondrial membrane potential monitoring, newly developed methods, such as mitochondrial ultrastructural determination, mtDNA mutation assays, metabolomics and analyses of regulatory mechanisms, have also been utilized in recent years. These approaches enable the accurate detection of mitochondrial abnormalities and provide guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of related diseases.","DNA, Mitochondrial",,"mitochondria,mitochondrial DNA,mitochondrial diseases,mitochondrial dysfunction,mitochondrial morphology","DNA, Mitochondrial,Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial,Mitochondria,Mutation,Oxidative Stress"

Despite the high efficacy, glucocorticoid treatments causes side effects such as obesity and insulin resistance in many patients.  their pharmacological target, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), glucocorticoids suppress endogenous glucocorticoid secretion. Endogenous, but not synthetic, glucocorticoids activate the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and side effects of synthetic glucocorticoids may thus not only result from GR hyperactivation but also from MR hypoactivation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that reactivation of MR with corticosterone add-on treatment can attenuate the metabolic effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Male 8-week-old C57Bl/6J mice received a high-fat diet supplemented with dexamethasone or vehicle, and were subcutaneously implanted with low-dose corticosterone- or vehicle-containing pellets. Dexamethasone strongly reduced body weight and fat mass gain, while corticosterone add-on partially normalized this. Dexamethasone-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia were exacerbated by corticosterone add-on, which was prevented by MR antagonism. In subcutaneous white adipose tissue, corticosterone add-on prevented the dexamethasone-induced expression of intracellular lipolysis genes. In brown adipose tissue, dexamethasone also upregulated gene expression of brown adipose tissue identity markers, lipid transporters and lipolysis enzymes, which was prevented by corticosterone add-on. In conclusion, corticosterone add-on treatment prevents several, while exacerbating other metabolic effects of dexamethasone. While the exact role of MR remains elusive, this study suggests that corticosterone suppression by dexamethasone contributes to its effects in mice.'}","Glucocorticoids,Receptors, Glucocorticoid,Dexamethasone,Corticosterone",,"Aldosterone,GR-MR crosstalk,corticosterone,dexamethasone,eplerenone,glucocorticoid receptor,hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis,mineralocorticoid receptor","Animals,Corticosterone,Dexamethasone,Glucocorticoids,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Receptors, Glucocorticoid"

Mitochondria are the center of intracellular energy metabolism and the main source of reactive oxygen species. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been identified as a key factor in diabetes-associated brain alterations contributing to neurodegenerative events. Defective insulin signaling may act in concert with neurodegenerative mechanisms leading to abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and function. Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers neuronal energy exhaustion and oxidative stress, leading to brain neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. The normality of mitochondrial function is basically maintained by mitochondrial quality control mechanisms. In T2DM, defects in the mitochondrial quality control pathway in the brain have been found to lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment.

In addition, they are also considered endocrine-disrupting chemicals and can interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, essential for the normal function of the male reproductive system, thus being able to provoke male reproductive dysfunctions. Although the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood, various signaling pathways, such as those mediated by acetylcholine or kisspeptin, are affected by exposure to carbamates, thus compromising steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. Over the last decades, several studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have reported a myriad of negative effects of carbamates on the male reproductive system.

Although gene regulation and master transcription factors involved in the hepatocyte differentiation have been extensively investigated, little is known about how the epigenome is regulated, particularly the dynamics of DNA methylation and the critical upstream factors. Here, by examining changes in the transcriptome and the methylome using an in vitro hepatocyte differentiation model, we show putative DNA methylation-regulating transcription factors, which are likely involved in DNA demethylation and maintenance of hypo-methylation in a differentiation stage-specific manner. Of these factors, we further reveal that GATA6 induces DNA demethylation together with chromatin activation in a binding-site-specific manner during endoderm differentiation. These results provide an insight into the spatiotemporal regulatory mechanisms exerted on the DNA methylation landscape by transcription factors and uncover an epigenetic role for transcription factors in early liver development.","GATA6 Transcription Factor,GATA6 protein, human",,,"Cell Differentiation,Chromatin Immunoprecipitation,DNA Methylation,GATA6 Transcription Factor,Hepatocytes,Humans"

The reproductive toxicity caused by dioxins is mostly mediated by an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). In animals, spermatogenesis is a highly sensitive and dynamic process that includes proliferation and maturation of germ cells. Spermatogenesis is subject to multiple endogenous and exogenous regulatory factors, including a wide range of environmental toxicants such as dioxins. This review discusses the toxicological effects of dioxins on spermatogenesis and their relevance to male infertility. After a detailed categorization of the environmental contaminants affecting the spermatogenesis, the exposure pathways and bioavailability of dioxins in animals was briefly reviewed. The effects of dioxins on spermatogenesis are then outlined in detail. The endocrine-disrupting effects of dioxins in animals and humans are discussed with a particular focus on their effects on the expression of spermatogenesis-related genes. Finally, the impacts of dioxins on the ratio of X and Y chromosomes, the status of serum sex hormones, the quality and fertility of sperm, and the transgenerational effects of dioxins on male reproduction are reviewed.",,,"dioxins,endocrine disrupter,environmental polluants,male infertility,spermatogenesis",

Even with normal values for free thyroxine, decreased values for the free-triiodothyronine/free-thyroxine ratio have already been described in adults. In this study, the free-triiodothyronine/free-thyroxine ratio of 25 children with congenital hypothyroidism was compared with 470 healthy children seen for other reasons and then for thyroid dysfunction. Mean free thyroxine in congenital hypothyroidism was just below the upper limit of normal and significantly higher than in control group. Mean values for free triiodothyronine showed no significant difference between the two groups. The mean value for the free triiodothyronine/free-thyroxine ratio in control group was 3.23. Significantly lower ratios were found in the congenital hypothyroidism group with a mean value of 2.5, due to higher values for free thyroxine compared to free triiodothyronine. Furthermore, an increased free triiodothyronine/free-thyroxine ratio was found at higher thyroid-stimulating hormone values due to lower values for free thyroxine. In this study, we demonstrate that the free triiodothyronine/free-thyroxine ratio was significantly lower in children with congenital hypothyroidism compared to the control group. This is most likely due to the higher values for free thyroxine in this group compared to similar values for free triiodothyronine in both groups.

Acute exposure to hypoxia promotes testosterone production via stimulation of autophagy and upregulation of steroidogenic enzymes and voltage-gated L-type calcium channel, nonetheless, chronic exposure to hypoxia impairs steroidogenesis via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Also, hypoxia distorts spermatogenesis and reduces sperm count, motility, and normal forms via upregulation of VEGF and oxidative stress-sensitive signaling. Furthermore, hypoxia induces sexual and erectile dysfunction via a testosterone-dependent downregulation of NO/cGMP signaling and upregulation of PGE1/TGFβ1-driven penile endothelial dysfunction. Notably, hypoxia programs male sexual function and spermatogenesis/sperm quality via feminization and demasculinization of males and oxidative stress-mediated alteration in sperm DNA methylation.

Furthermore, vessel permeability and transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis signaling pathways, particularly those that involved vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were disrupted in the absence of 5α-reductase. In  mice, injection of dihydrotestosterone co-incident with decidualization restored decidualization responses, vessel permeability, and expression of angiogenesis genes to wild type levels. Androgen availability declines with age which may contribute to age-related risk of pregnancy disorders. These findings show that intracrine androgen signaling is required for optimal decidualization  and confirm a major role for androgens in the development of the vasculature during decidualization through regulation of the VEGF pathway.

During the past three decades, obesity has rapidly increased in the whole human population worldwide, including women of reproductive age. It is known that maternal obesity caused by a high-fat diet may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders in their offspring, such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. A maternal high-fat diet can affect offspring neurodevelopment due to inflammatory activation of the maternal gut, adipose tissue, and placenta, mirrored by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both maternal and fetal circulation. Furthermore, a maternal high fat diet causes gut microbial dysbiosis further contributing to increased inflammatory milieu during pregnancy and lactation, thus disturbing both prenatal and postnatal neurodevelopment of the offspring. In addition, global molecular and cellular changes in the offspring's brain may occur due to epigenetic modifications including the downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and the activation of the endocannabinoid system.

Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the principal receptors for the hormone aldosterone, play an important role in regulating renal sodium handling and blood pressure. Recent studies suggest that MRs also exist in tissues outside the kidney, including vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, perivascular adipose tissue, and immune cells. Risk factors, including excessive salt intake/salt sensitivity, hypertension, and obesity, can lead to the activation of vascular MRs to promote inflammation, oxidative stress, remodeling, and fibrosis, as well as cardiovascular stiffening and microcirculatory impairment. These pathophysiological changes are associated with a diminished ability of insulin to initiate appropriate intracellular signaling events, resulting in a reduced glucose uptake within the microcirculation and related vascular insulin resistance. Therefore, the pharmacological inhibition of MR activation provides a potential therapeutic option for improving vascular function, glucose uptake, and vascular insulin sensitivity. This review highlights recent experimental and clinical data that support the contribution of abnormal MR activation to the development of vascular insulin resistance and dysfunction.","Insulin,Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists,Mineralocorticoids,Receptors, Mineralocorticoid,Aldosterone,Glucose",,"aldosterone,diabetes,insulin resistance,mineralocorticoid receptors,vascular dysfunctions","Aldosterone,Blood Pressure,Endothelial Cells,Glucose,Humans,Insulin,Insulin Resistance,Microcirculation,Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists,Mineralocorticoids,Receptors, Mineralocorticoid"

The currently accepted ""glucocorticoid resistance"" model posits this increased inflammation as a consequence of reduced sensitivity to cortisol's putative anti-inflammatory action. However, opposing evidence has accumulated that supports a more recent model, which instead proposes that cortisol possesses immune potentiating properties and may thus directly cause the increased inflammation seen in depression. Despite all of this, a clear explanation of the neuroendocrine mechanism that contributes to the development of depression is still lacking and thus requires further investigation in improved future studies.",,,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,cortisol,glucocorticoid receptor,glucocorticoid resistance,inflammation,major depressive disorder",

Whether BPA can affect and reprogram early adipogenic differentiation signals that trigger adipogenic differentiation, remains unknown. We hypothesized that gestational BPA exposure results in a preadipocyte phenotype that leads to accelerated adipogenic differentiation, and that this phenotype is sex specific. Primary ovine fetal preadipocytes were derived from control (C) and BPA-exposed during pregnancy and differentiated in vitro. Gestational BPA enhanced lipid accumulation at early stages of differentiation (48 h) and this was evident in females but not male-derived fetal preadipocytes. After an RNA sequencing approach, samples were compared as follows: 2 groups (C vs. BPA); 2 sexes (female (F) vs. male (M)); and 2 time points (0 h vs. 48 h). Before differentiation, 15 genes were differentially expressed between the C and the BPA-exposed preadipocytes within sex. In BPA-F, extracellular matrix remodeling genes cathepsin K and collagen 5α3 were upregulated compared to C-F. At 48 h, BPA-F had 154 genes differentially expressed vs. C-F and BPA-M had 487 genes differentially expressed vs. C-M. Triglyceride and glycerophospholipid metabolism were the most upregulated pathways in BPA-F. Downregulated pathways were associated with extracellular matrix organization in BPA-exposed preadipocytes.

Therefore, the study indicates the inhibitory effect of mitochondria from different genders on hepatocellular carcinoma and explores the molecular mechanism. The results reveal that the healthy mitochondria can retard the proliferation of the hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo through arresting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. The molecular mechanism suggests that mitochondrial transplantation therapy can decrease aerobic glycolysis, and down-regulate the expression of cycle-related proteins while up-regulate apoptosis-related proteins in tumor cells. In addition, the antitumor activity of mitochondria from female mice (F-Mito) is relatively higher than that of mitochondria from male mice (M-Mito), which would be related to the evidence that the F-Mito process higher activity than the M-Mito.

After follicle-stimulating hormone binds to its receptor and activates the follicle-stimulating hormone signaling pathway, follicle-stimulating hormone signaling will establish a normal Sertoli cell number and promote their differentiation. Spermatogonia pool maintenance, spermatogonia differentiation and their entry into meiosis are also positively regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone signaling.

To gain a better understanding of the effects of iron deficiency on the reproductive system, especially spermatogenesis, we first constructed a mouse model of iron deficiency. We employed multi-omic analysis, including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics, to comprehensively dissect the impact of iron deficiency on spermatogenesis. Moreover, we verified our findings in detail using western blot, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and other techniques. Microbiomic analysis revealed altered gut microbiota in iron-deficient mice, and functional predictive analysis showed that gut microbiota can regulate spermatogenesis. The transcriptomic data indicated that iron deficiency directly alters expression of meiosis-related genes. Transcriptome data also revealed that iron deficiency indirectly regulates spermatogenesis by affecting hormone synthesis, findings confirmed by metabolomic data, western blot and immunofluorescence. Interestingly, competing endogenous RNA networks also play a vital role in regulating spermatogenesis after iron deficiency. Taken together, the data elucidate that iron deficiency impairs spermatogenesis and increases the risk of male infertility by affecting hormone synthesis and promoting gut microbiota imbalance.","Iron,Hormones",,"CeRNA,Gut microbiome,Iron deficiency,Multi-omics,Spermatogenesis","Male,Mice,Animals,Iron Deficiencies,Spermatogenesis,Metabolomics,Iron,Hormones"

The duration, quantity, and period of exposure to BPA, especially during the critical stage of development, determine its impact on reproductive and non-reproductive health. Because of its endocrine-disrupting effects, the European Chemical Agency has added BPA to the candidate list of chemicals of very high concern. Due to its estrogenic properties and structural similarities with thyroid hormones, BPA disrupts the endocrine system at different levels. It interacts with estrogen receptors at the molecular level and acts as an antagonist or agonist via an estrogen receptor-dependent signaling pathway. In particular, BPA binds to G-protein coupled receptors and estrogen receptors, activating signaling pathways that influence cellular apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. BPA acts as an obesogen that promotes adipogenesis and correlates with increased lipid accumulation and elevated expression of adipogenic markers.

Before birth, glucocorticoids are primarily maturational signals that prepare the fetus for new postnatal challenges. However, the role of the normal prepartum glucocorticoid rise in preparing mitochondria for the increased postnatal energy demands remains largely unknown. This study examined the effect of physiological increases in the fetal cortisol concentration on cerebral mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity near term (~130 days gestation, term ~145 days gestation). Fetal sheep were infused with saline or cortisol for 5 days at ~0.8 of gestation before the mitochondrial content, respiratory rates, abundance of the electron transfer system proteins and OXPHOS efficiency were measured in their cortex and cerebellum. Cerebral morphology was assessed by immunohistochemistry and stereology. Cortisol treatment increased the mitochondrial content, while decreasing Complex I-linked respiration in the cerebellum. There was no effect on the cortical mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity. Cortisol infusion had regional effects on cerebral morphology, with increased myelination in the cerebrum. The findings demonstrate the importance of cortisol in regulating the cerebral mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity prenatally and have implications for infants born preterm or after glucocorticoid overexposure due to pregnancy complications or clinical treatment.","Glucocorticoids,Hydrocortisone",,"brain,cortisol,fetus,mitochondria","Animals,Brain,Female,Fetus,Gestational Age,Glucocorticoids,Humans,Hydrocortisone,Mitochondria,Oxidative Phosphorylation,Pregnancy,Sheep"

However, little information is available concerning the effects of paternal high-fat diet (HFD) exposure on triglyceride metabolism in the offspring. Therefore, we investigated the effects of paternal HFD on triglyceride metabolism and related gene expression in male mouse offspring. We found that paternal HFD exposure significantly increased the body weight, liver and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) weights, and liver triglyceride content in male offspring, despite consuming control diet. In addition, paternal HFD exposure had induced changes in the mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid and triglyceride metabolism in the liver and eWAT.

Here, we establish a real-time PM exposure model and revealed that PM exposure could lead to testicular dysfunction including spermatogenesis impairment and steroid hormone dysfunction. In particular, the decrease in the testicular global level of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) indicated a possible association of DNA methylation with testicular injury induced by PM exposure. Further genome-wide methylation analysis revealed genomic hypomethylation of testicular DNA and identified more than 1000 differentially methylated regions in both CAP and UA versus FA, indicating that PM exposure, even low-dose, could modulate the testicular methylome. Furthermore, integrated analysis of methylome and transcriptome identified some key methylated genes and networks, which may be involved in spermatogenesis and synthesis of steroid hormone.

We are now beginning to understand how this stress hormone response impacts important processes such as DNA repair and cell proliferation processes in breast cancer. However, it is not known what epigenetic changes stress hormones induce in breast cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms include modification of DNA and histones within chromatin that may be involved in governing the transcriptional processes in cancer cells in response to changes by endogenous stress hormones. The contribution of endogenous acute or long-term exposure of glucocorticoid stress hormones, and exogenous glucocorticoids to methylation patterns in breast cancer tissues with different aetiologies remains to be evaluated. In vitro and in vivo models were developed to investigate the epigenetic modifications and their contribution to breast cancer progression and aetiology. A panel of triple negative breast cancer cell lines were treated with the glucocorticoid, cortisol which resulted in epigenetic alteration characterised by loss of methylation on promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes including ESR1, and loss of methylation on LINE-1 repetitive element used as a surrogate marker for global methylation. This was verified in vivo in MDA-MB-231 xenografts; the model verified the loss of methylation on ESR1 promoter, and subsequent increase in ESR1 expression in primary tumours in mice subjected to restraint stress.

With the restriction of the plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), the search for safe substitutes gained importance. Focusing on the master regulator of adipogenesis and adipose tissue functionality, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), we evaluated 20 alternative plasticizers as well as their metabolites for binding to and activation of PPARγ and assessed effects on adipocyte lipid accumulation. Among several compounds that showed interaction with PPARγ, the metabolites MINCH, MHINP, and OH-MPHP of the plasticizers DINCH, DINP, and DPHP exerted the highest adipogenic potential in human adipocytes. These metabolites and their parent plasticizers were further analyzed in human preadipocytes and mature adipocytes using cellular assays and global proteomics. In preadipocytes, the plasticizer metabolites significantly increased lipid accumulation, enhanced leptin and adipsin secretion, and upregulated adipogenesis-associated markers and pathways, in a similar pattern to the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. Proteomics of mature adipocytes revealed that both, the plasticizers and their metabolites, induced oxidative stress, disturbed lipid storage, impaired metabolic homeostasis, and led to proinflammatory and insulin resistance promoting adipokine secretion. In conclusion, the plasticizer metabolites enhanced preadipocyte differentiation, at least partly mediated by PPARγ activation and, together with their parent plasticizers, affected the functionality of mature adipocytes similar to reported effects of a high-fat diet.

Many factors contribute to IR, including lifestyle variables such as a high-fat diet and physical inactivity, genetics, and impaired mitochondrial function. It is well established that impaired mitochondria structure and function occur in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle volunteers with T2D or obesity.

Here we will review changes in metabolites and metabolic pathways in TAMs and link these with the phenotypic and functional properties of the cells.

Taste is an ancient chemical sense that has an essential role in the animal's response to carbohydrates in the external environment and is involved in the body's energy perception. In recent years, numerous studies have confirmed that taste signaling factors (taste receptor families 1, 2 and their downstream molecules, Gα and PLCβ2) are distributed in testes and epididymis tissues outside the oral cavity. Their functions are directly linked to spermatogenesis, maturation, and fertilization, which are potential targets for regulating male reproduction.

The standard treatment for testosterone deficiency remains testosterone replacement therapy. However, limitations on its use and the risk of significant adverse effects make alternative therapeutics desirable. Studies on the mechanisms regulating and synthesizing testosterone formation in testicular Leydig cells demonstrate numerous endogenous targets that could increase testosterone biosynthesis, which could alleviate reduced testosterone effects. Testosterone biosynthesis is facilitated by a conglomerate of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins that facilitate cholesterol translocation into the mitochondria, the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. An effective therapeutic approach would be required to increase endogenous testosterone formation by enhancing steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. Numerous ligands for steroidogenic proteins have been developed, which increase steroid hormone formation. However, off-target effects on neurosteroid and adrenal steroid formation may limit their clinical use.

When the MSC pool is damaged, it is often correlated with impaired development or health of the organism. MSC are known for their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and trophic characteristics that play an important role in the physiological homeostasis of many tissues. Heat shock impairs MSC capacity by inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction, which, in turn, send the cells into a state of premature senescence. Here, we pre-exposed MSC to melatonin, resveratrol, or curcumin, which are natural antioxidative compounds, and tested the protective effects of these substances from oxidative stress and aging. Our data showed that pre-exposure of MSC to antioxidants decreased reactive oxygen species while mitochondrial damage remained high. Additionally, although the proliferation of the cells was slow, antioxidants protected the cells from premature senescence, and subsequent cytokine release was prevented. We conclude that while elevated temperatures directly cause mitochondrial damage, senescence is induced by elevated ROS levels. We suggest that heat shock alters cell and tissue homeostasis by several independent mechanisms; however, reducing tissue senescence will reduce damage and provide a pathway to overcome physiological challenges in animals.","Antioxidants,Reactive Oxygen Species",,"antioxidants,curcumin,heat shock,melatonin,mesenchymal stem cells,resveratrol,senescence","Animals,Antioxidants,Cattle,Cellular Senescence,Heat-Shock Response,Mesenchymal Stem Cells,Reactive Oxygen Species"

Inflammageing, one of the hallmarks of aging, represents a chronic, low key but a persistent inflammatory state. Oxidative stress, alterations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mis-localized extra-mitochondrial mtDNA are suggested to directly induce various immune response pathways. This could ultimately perturb cellular homeostasis and lead to pathological consequences. Epigenetic remodelling of mtDNA by DNA methylation, post-translational modifications of mtDNA binding proteins and regulation of mitochondrial gene expression by nuclear DNA or mtDNA encoded non-coding RNAs, are suggested to directly correlate with the onset and progression of various types of cancer. Mitochondria are also capable of regulating immune response to various infections and tissue damage by producing pro- or anti-inflammatory signals. This occurs by altering the levels of mitochondrial metabolites and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels.

Previous studies indicate that a regulatory loop may exist between them. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that glucocorticoids stimulate hepatic PPARα expression via GRα at the transcriptional level. This stimulation of PPARα by GRα has physiological relevance and PPARα is involved in many glucocorticoid-induced pathophysiological processes, including gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis during fasting, insulin resistance, hypertension and anti-inflammatory effects. PPARα also synergizes with GRα to promote erythroid progenitor self-renewal. As the feedback, PPARα inhibits glucocorticoid actions at pre-receptor and receptor levels. PPARα decreases glucocorticoid production through inhibiting the expression and activity of type-1 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts inactive glucocorticoids to active glucocorticoids at local tissues, and also down-regulates hepatic GRα expression, thus forming a complete and negative feedback loop. This negative feedback loop sheds light on prospective multi-drug therapeutic treatments in inflammatory diseases through a combination of glucocorticoids and PPARα agonists.

Multiple mitochondrial adaptation processes, including mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial metabolism, and mitochondrial apoptotic regulatory machinery, have been demonstrated to be potential targets. However, recent increasing insights into mitochondria have revealed the complexity of mitochondrial structure and functions, the elusive functions of mitochondria in tumor biology, and the targeting inaccessibility of mitochondria, which have posed challenges for the clinical application of mitochondrial-based cancer therapeutic strategies. Therefore, discovery of both novel mitochondria-targeting agents and innovative mitochondria-targeting approaches is urgently required. Here, we review the most recent literature to summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial stress adaptation and their intricate connection with cancer drug resistance. In addition, an overview of the emerging strategies to target mitochondria for effectively overcoming chemoresistance is highlighted, with an emphasis on drug repositioning and mitochondrial drug delivery approaches, which may accelerate the application of mitochondria-targeting compounds for cancer therapy.",,,"Cancer drug resistance,Drug repurposing,Mitochondrial adaptation,Mitochondrial dynamics,Mitochondrial transplantation,Mitochondrial-targeted drug delivery","Drug Resistance, Neoplasm,Humans,Mitochondria,Mitochondrial Dynamics,Neoplasms,Prevalence"

Many studies have suggested that prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is associated with hypospadias and cryptorchidism development. However, the consistent mechanisms remain unclear. To identify the key EDCs, genes and biological networks related to the development of hypospadias and cryptorchidism respectively and commonly, we conduct the present study and found a new method for predicting the correlation between the interactive genes of hypospadias/cryptorchidism and chemicals. Transcriptome profiles were obtained from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were applied for integrative analyses. The rat model and molecular docking were applied to furtherly verifying the findings of the integrative analyses. Besides the highly related genes, most enriched pathways and chemicals for hypospadias and cryptorchidism respectively, we found hypospadias and cryptorchidism share many same highly associated EDCs (e.g., dibutyl phthalate) and genes (e.g., androgen receptor and estrogen receptor 1) through comparing highly related chemicals or genes of hypospadias and cryptorchidism respectively. GO and KEGG analysis showed that these same interactive genes were mainly enriched in steroidogenesis, response to steroid hormone and nuclear receptor activity. PPI network analysis identified 15 biological hub genes. Furtherly, hypospadias and cryptorchidism were induced by prenatal dibutyl phthalate exposure. Decreased serum testosterone level, downregulation of nuclear androgen-dependent and upregulation of cytoplasmic estrogen-dependent pathways may lead to hypospadias and cryptorchidism.

Fluoride invades into cells and mainly damages mitochondria, resulting in decreased activity of mitochondrial related enzymes, weakening of protein expression, damage of respiratory chain, excessive fission, disturbance of fusion, disorder of calcium regulation, resulting in the decrease of intracellular ATP and the accumulation of Reactive oxygen species. At the same time, the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential leads to the release of Cyt c, causing a series of caspase cascade reactions and resulting in apoptosis.

Tumor cells reprogram their metabolic pathways to meet the material, energy and redox force needs for rapid proliferation. Metabolic reprogramming changes the level or type of specific metabolites inside and outside cells, and promotes tumor growth by affecting gene expression, cell state and the tumor microenvironment. Glucose metabolism, glutamine metabolism and lipid metabolism are significant metabolic pathways in tumors. Targeting metabolic reprogramming can significantly inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis. Metabolic reprogramming also plays an important role in maintaining the growth advantage of tumor cells and enhancing the chemotherapy tolerance of lung cancer.

Endocrinology and metabolism,Journal Article,"{'b': 'NEW & NOTEWORTHY', '#text': 'Maternal obesity is exceedingly common and strongly linked to offspring obesity and metabolic disease. Hypothalamic function is critical to obesity development. Hypothalamic mechanisms causing obesity following exposure to maternal obesity have not been elucidated. Therefore, we studied a cohort of C57BL/6J dams, treated with a control or high-fat-high-sugar diet, and their adult offspring to explore potential hypothalamic mechanisms to explain the link between maternal and offspring obesity. Dams treated with obesogenic diet were heavier with mild insulin resistance, which is reflective of the most common metabolic disease in pregnancy. Adult offspring exposed to maternal obesogenic diet had no change in body weight but significant increase in fat mass, decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, elevated plasma leptin, and elevated plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone. In addition, offspring exposed to maternal obesity had decreased energy intake and activity without change in basal metabolic rate. Hypothalamic neurochemical profile and transcriptome demonstrated decreased neuronal activity and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Collectively, these results indicate that maternal obesity without diabetes is associated with adiposity and decreased hypothalamic energy production in offspring. We hypothesize that altered hypothalamic function significantly contributes to obesity development. Future studies focused on neuroprotective strategies aimed to improve hypothalamic function may decrease obesity development. Offspring exposed to maternal diet-induced obesity demonstrate a phenotype consistent with energy excess. Contrary to previous studies, the observed energy phenotype was not associated with hyperphagia or decreased basal metabolic rate but rather decreased hypothalamic neuronal activity and energy production. This was supported by neurochemical changes in the hypothalamus as well as inhibition of hypothalamic oxidative phosphorylation pathway.

Here, we demonstrate that vimentin is released mainly from the back of macrophage-like cells. This polarisation is strongly enhanced upon macrophage activation. One-dimensional patterned lines showed that extracellular cell-surface vimentin is localised primarily at the back of activated macrophage-like cells. Through two-dimensional migration and phagocytosis assays, we show that this extracellular vimentin enhances migration and phagocytosis of macrophage-like cells.

Its frequency is approximately 3% of that of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Considering that the small intestine occupies 90% of the surface area of the gastrointestinal tract, small intestinal adenocarcinoma is very rare. The main site of small intestinal adenocarcinoma is the proximal small intestine. Based on this characteristic, dietary animal proteins/lipids and bile concentrations are implicated and reported to be involved in carcinogenesis. Since most nutrients are absorbed in the proximal small intestine, the effect of absorbable intestinal content is a suitable explanation for why small intestinal adenocarcinoma is more common in the proximal small intestine. The proportion of aerobic bacteria is high in the proximal small intestine, but the absolute number of bacteria is low. In addition, the length and density of villi are greater in the proximal small intestine. However, the involvement of villi is considered to be low because the number of small intestinal adenocarcinomas is much smaller than that of colorectal adenocarcinomas. On the other hand, the reason for the low incidence of small intestinal adenocarcinoma in the distal small intestine may be that immune organs reside there. Genetic and disease factors increase the likelihood of small intestinal adenocarcinoma. In carcinogenesis experiments in which the positions of the small and large intestines were exchanged, tumors still occurred in the large intestinal mucosa more often. In other words, the influence of the intestinal contents is small, and there is a large difference in epithelial properties between the small intestine and the large intestine.

It is widely distributed and can be transported from agricultural fields to the aquatic environment via soil run-off. Zearalenone exposure can cause serious health problems to humans and animals, including estrogenic, immunotoxic, and xenogenic effects. Though its hepatotoxicity has been reported by few studies, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be investigated. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the hepatotoxic effects of zearalenone and its molecular mechanism in the zebrafish model system. First, we found zearalenone exposure can cause liver injury, as evidenced by reduced liver size, decreased liver-specific fluorescence, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, delayed yolk sac absorption and lipid accumulation. Then, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed using dissected zebrafish fry liver, which found genes involved in oxidation and reduction were significantly enriched. Quantitative real-time PCR further confirmed the dysregulated expression of several antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, lipid peroxidation was proved by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) production and gene expression at the mRNA level. In contrast to the previous study, apoptosis was likely decreased in response to zearalenone exposure. Last, glucuronidation and amino acid metabolism were also disrupted by zearalenone. Our results revealed the complex mechanism of zearalenone-induced hepatotoxicity, which is a valuable contribution to a more comprehensive understanding of the toxicity of zearalenone.","Amino Acids,Antioxidants,Aspartate Aminotransferases,Lipids,Malondialdehyde,Mycotoxins,RNA, Messenger,Soil,Zearalenone",,"Hepatotoxicity,Transcriptomics,Zearalenone,Zebrafish","Animals,Amino Acids,Antioxidants,Aspartate Aminotransferases,Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury,Lipids,Malondialdehyde,Mycotoxins,RNA, Messenger,Soil,Transcriptome,Zearalenone,Zebrafish"

Human-altered environments, such as those resulting from the increasing use of pesticides, may be major drivers of such cross-generational influences, which in turn may have profound evolutionary and ecological repercussions. Most of these consequences are, however, unknown. Whether transgenerational plasticity elicited by pesticide exposure is common, and the consequences of its potential carryover effects on fitness and population dynamics, remains to be determined. Here, we investigate whether exposure of parents to a common pesticide elicits intra-, inter-, and transgenerational responses (in F0, F1, and F2 generations) in life history (fecundity, longevity, and lifetime reproductive success), in an insect model system, the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We also assessed sex specificity of the effects. We found sex-specific and hormetic intergenerational and transgenerational effects on longevity and lifetime reproductive success, manifested both in the form of maternal and paternal effects. In addition, the transgenerational effects via mothers detected in this study are consistent with a new concept: terminal investment transgenerational effects. Such effects could underlie cross-generational responses to environmental perturbation.

Oxidative stress is one of the most crucial factors involved in infertility. Recent studies indicate that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) may cause damage to the male and female reproductive systems leading to infertility. Low amounts of ROS and RNS are essential for the normal functioning of the male and female reproductive systems, such as sperm motility, acrosome reaction, interactions with oocytes, ovulation, and the maturation of follicles. Environmental factors such as heavy metals can cause reproductive dysfunction in men and women through the overproduction of ROS and RNS. It is suggested that oxidative stress caused by arsenic is associated with male and female reproductive disorders such as through the alteration in sperm counts and motility, decreased sex hormones, dysfunction of the testis and ovary, as well as damage to the processes of spermatogenesis and oogenesis.

It was thought for many years that the specificity of hormone response lay in the ligand. Although this may be true for pure agonists, the natural ligands as progesterone, corticosterone and cortisol present a broader effect by simultaneous activation of several SHRs. Moreover, SHRs share structural and functional characteristics that range from similarities between ligand-binding pockets to recognition of specific DNA sequences. These properties are clearly evident in progesterone (PR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR); however, the biological responses triggered by each receptor in the presence of its ligand are different, and in some cases, even opposite. Thus, what confers the specificity of response to a given receptor is a long-standing topic of discussion that has not yet been unveiled. The levels of expression of each receptor, the differential interaction with coregulators, the chromatin accessibility as well as the DNA sequence of the target regions in the genome, are reliable sources of variability in hormone action that could explain the results obtained so far.

Male and female brains display subtle differences at the cellular level which may be important in driving sex-specific signaling. Sex differences in the brain have been observed in humans as well as in non-human species. However, the molecular mechanisms of brain sex differentiation remain unclear. The classical model of brain sex differentiation suggests that the steroid hormones derived from the gonads are the primary determinants in establishing male and female neural networks. Recent studies indicate that the developing brain shows sex-specific differences in gene expression prior to gonadal hormone action. Hence, genetic differences may also be responsible for differentiating the brain into male and female types. Understanding the signaling mechanisms involved in brain sex differentiation could help further elucidate the sex-specific incidences of certain neurological diseases.

Zebrafish brains show sex-specific differences at the hormonal level, and recent advances in RNA sequencing have highlighted critical sex-specific differences at the transcript level. The differences are also evident at the cellular and metabolite levels, which could be important in organizing sex-specific neuronal signaling. Furthermore, in addition to having one ortholog for 70% of the human gene, zebrafish also shares brain structural similarities with other higher eukaryotes, including mammals. Hence, deciphering brain sex differentiation in zebrafish will help further enhance the diagnostic and pharmacological intervention of neurological diseases.",,,"Differentiation,Disease,Gonads,Neurons,Steroid hormones","Animals,Brain,Female,Gonads,Male,Mammals,Sex Characteristics,Sex Differentiation,Zebrafish"

Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that constantly change their morphology to elongated (fusion) or small and spherical (fission). These mitochondrial dynamics are regulated by various small GTPases, Drp1, Fis1, Mitofusin, and Opa1. Mitochondrial fission and fusion are essential to maintain a balance between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial turnover. Recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial dynamics play a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular diseases and senescence. Disruptions in mitochondrial dynamics affect mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyocyte survival leading to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Mitochondrial dynamics and reactive oxygen species production have been associated with endothelial dysfunction, which in turn causes the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and even pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Low estrogen is related to changes in DNA methylation and consequent alterations in gene expression, leading to a new direction in research related to the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. We constructed an Ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model in our study, and the mouse models had osteoporosis based on the phenotype and methylation levels in the mouse's bone. Furthermore, the methylation level of the OVX mice was significantly changed compared to that of SHAM mice. Therefore, we performed genome-level analysis on the mouse model using transcriptome and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) by combining the data of two omics and discovered that the changes in gene expression level caused by osteoporosis primarily focused on the decrease of bone and muscle development and the activation of the immune system. According to intersection analysis of methylation and transcriptome data, the differentially expressed genes and pathways are consistent with the differentially expressed methylation locations and regions. Further, the differentially expressed methylation sites were mainly concentrated in promoters, exons, and other critical functional regions of essential differentially expressed genes. This is also the primary cause of gene differential expression variations, indicating that estrogen deficiency might regulate gene expression by altering methylation modification, leading to osteoporosis. We demonstrated the clinical value of methylation modification research, and these findings would improve the current understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of osteoporosis incidence and development and provide new ideas for early detection and treatment of osteoporosis.",,,"5 mC,DNA methylation,estrogen,osteoporosis,transcriptome",

A series of disruptive behaviors to body homeostasis brought about by light pollution, including metabolic abnormalities, are likely to be the result of circadian rhythm disturbances. Recently, the proposed role of light pollution in metabolic dysregulation has accelerated it into an emerging field. Hence, the regulatory role of light pollution in mammalian metabolic homeostasis is reviewed in this contribution. Light at night is the most widely affected type of light pollution, which disrupts metabolic homeostasis largely due to its disruption of daily food intake patterns, alterations of hormone levels such as melatonin and glucocorticoids, and changes in the rhythm of inflammatory factor production. Besides, light pollution impairs mammalian metabolic processes in an intensity-, photoperiod-, and wavelength-dependent manner, and is also affected by species, gender, and diets. Nevertheless, metabolic disorders triggered by light pollution are not irreversible to some extent. Potential interventions such as melatonin supplementation, recovery to the LD cycle, time-restricted feeding, voluntary exercise, wearing blue light-shied goggles, and bright morning light therapy open a bright avenue to prevent light pollution.

The alkyl chain length of the paraben esters positively correlates with their antimicrobial property. Hence, long-chain paraben esters, namely butylparaben and propylparaben, are used in combination as they have better solubility and antimicrobial efficacy. Extensive use of parabens has now resulted in the ubiquitous presence of these compounds in various human and environmental matrices. During early life, exposure to environmental contaminants is known to cause oxidative-stress mediated apoptosis in developing organs. The brain being one of the high oxygen-consuming, metabolically active and lipid-rich organ, it is primarily susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LP) induced neuronal cell death. The primary cause for the impairment in cognitive and emotional neurobehvioural outcomes in neurodegenerative disease was found to be associated with neuronal apoptosis. The present study aimed to study butylparaben and propylparaben's effect on zebrafish during early embryonic stages. Besides this, the association between alteration in anxiety-like neurobehavioral response with oxidative stress and antioxidant status in head region was also studied. The study results showed variation in the toxic signature left by butylparaben and propylparaben on developmental parameters such as hatching rate, survival and non-lethal malformations in a time-dependent manner. Data from the light-dark preference test showed embryonic exposure to butylparaben and propylparaben to trigger anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish larvae. In addition, a significant increase in intracellular ROS and LP levels correlated with suppressed antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalases (CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and Glutathione (GSH) activity in the head region of the zebrafish larvae. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also suppressed in the exposed groups, along with increased nitric oxide production. The overall observations show increased oxidative stress indices correlating with upregulated expression of apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings reveal butylparaben and propylparaben as an anxiogenic neuroactive compound capable of inducing anxiety-like behavior through a mechanism involving oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis in the head of zebrafish larvae, which suggests a potential hazard to the early life of zebrafish and this can be extrapolated to human health as well.","Antioxidants,Parabens,Reactive Oxygen Species,butylparaben,Acetylcholinesterase,Glutathione,propylparaben",,"anxiety-like behavior,apoptosis,developmental toxicity,oxidative stress,paraben,zebrafish","Acetylcholinesterase,Animals,Antioxidants,Anxiety,Apoptosis,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Glutathione,Larva,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Oxidative Stress,Parabens,Reactive Oxygen Species,Zebrafish"

While identifying covariates for a study of placental protein expression, we found a significant negative correlation between maternal age and the expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), and a significant positive correlation between maternal age and the expression of the serotonin transporter SERT. MAOA and SERT play key roles in placental serotonin metabolism relevant to fetal neurodevelopment. These preliminary findings suggest that the effect of increasing maternal age on neurodevelopmental risk may be mediated in part by changes in placental protein expression relevant to fetal serotonin metabolism.","Serotonin,Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins,Monoamine Oxidase,Pregnancy Proteins",,"Fetal neurodevelopment,Maternal age,Neuro-developmental disorders,Serotonin metabolism","Pregnancy,Female,Humans,Placenta,Serotonin,Maternal Age,Fetus,Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins,Monoamine Oxidase,Pregnancy Proteins"

Endothelial cells display important homeostatic functions, since they are able to respond to humoral and hemodynamic stimuli. Thus, endothelial dysfunction has been proposed as a key and early pathogenic mechanism in many clinical conditions. Given the relevant repercussions on cardiovascular risk, the complex interplay between endothelial dysfunction and systemic arterial hypertension has been a matter of study in recent years. Numerous articles have been published on this issue, all of which contribute to providing an interesting insight into the molecular mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction in arterial hypertension and its role as a biomarker of inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular disease. The prognostic and therapeutic implications of endothelial dysfunction have also been analyzed in this clinical setting, with interesting new findings and potential applications in clinical practice and future research.

It has been observed that there is a gradual rise in male diabetic patients and almost half of the diabetic males have low semen quality and decrease reproductive function. In diabetic conditions, prolonged hyperglycemia leads to oxidative stress, diabetic neuropathy, and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance and its deficiency can impair the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, gonads, and perigonads. This causes a decrease in the secretion of gonadal steroids such as GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), and Testosterone. Moreover, it also causes damage to the testicles, spermatogenic and stromal cells, seminiferous tubules, and various structural injuries to male reproductive organs. During spermatogenesis, glucose metabolism plays an important role, because the fundamental activities of cells and their specific features, such as motility and mature sperm fertilization activity, are maintained by glucose metabolism. All these activities can influence the fertility and reproductive health of males. But the glucose metabolism is primarily disrupted in diabetic conditions. Until now, there has been no medicine focusing on the reproductive health of diabetic people. In this chapter, we review the consequences of diabetes on the reproductive system of males and all the pathways involved in the dysfunction of the reproductive system.

However, factors such as chemical and physical characteristics of the diet and/or environmental stressors can continuously affect this balance, potentially inducing a state of chronic low-grade inflammation in the gut, where inflammatory parameters are present and demanding energy, but not in enough intensity to provoke clinical manifestations. It's vital to expand the understanding of inflammation dynamics and of how they compromise the function activity and microscopic morphology of the intestinal mucosa. These morphometric alterations are associated with the release of structural and functional cellular components into the feces and the blood stream creating measurable biomarkers to track this condition. Moreover, the identification of novel, immunometabolic biomarkers can provide dynamic and predictors of low-grade chronic inflammation, but also provide indicators of successful nutritional or feed additive intervention strategies. The objective of this paper is to review the mechanisms of low-grade inflammation, its effects on animal production and sustainability, and the biomarkers that could provide early diagnosis of this process and support studies of useful interventional strategies.",,,"gut integrity,immunometabolism,intestinal biomarkers,low-grade inflammation",

Impairment in skeletal muscle and the cardiovascular system, two interrelated systems, results in compromised functional status in aging. Increased oxidative stress and inflammation in older subjects constitute the background for skeletal muscle and cardiovascular system alterations. Aged skeletal muscle mass and strength impairment is related to anabolic resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress and inflammation as well as a reduced antioxidant response and myokine profile. Arterial stiffness and endothelial function stand out as the main cardiovascular alterations related to aging, where increased systemic and vascular oxidative stress and inflammation play a key role. Physical activity and exercise training arise as modifiable determinants of functional outcomes in older persons. Exercise enhances antioxidant response, decreases age-related oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory signals, and promotes the activation of anabolic and mitochondrial biogenesis pathways in skeletal muscle. Additionally, exercise improves endothelial function and arterial stiffness by reducing inflammatory and oxidative damage signaling in vascular tissue together with an increase in antioxidant enzymes and nitric oxide availability, globally promoting functional performance and healthy aging.

Specifically, protein acetylation is thought to direct feedback from metabolism, whereby nutritional status influences mitochondrial pathways including beta-oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. Acetylation provides a crucial connection between hepatic metabolism and mitochondrial function. Dysregulation of protein acetylation throughout the cell can alter mitochondrial function and is associated with numerous liver diseases, including non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

We conducted an electronic search using PubMed on endocrine disruptors related to oxidative stress and male infertility, and evaluated their association with endocrine-disrupting chemicals (bisphenols, phthalates, and parabens) in 25 articles. Higher levels of urinary bisphenols showed correlation with impaired semen quality and increased DNA damage. Considering phthalates and their metabolites, all studies found a positive association between urinary levels of phthalates and at least one semen parameter indicative of low semen quality; some studies also revealed sperm DNA damage. The studies on parabens less often revealed correlation of urinary parabens concentrations with a decrease in sperm count, as well as motility and DNA damage. Moreover, EDCs can elevate ROS production and lipid peroxidation, increase apoptosis, induce epigenetic modifications, and change the Y:X sperm chromosome ratio and sperm protein composition.

Plant-based antioxidants are mainly phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and vitamins, while animal-based antioxidants are mainly whole protein or the peptides of meat, fish, egg, milk, and plant proteins. Plant-based antioxidants mainly consist of aromatic rings, while animal-based antioxidants mainly consist of amino acids. The phenolic compounds and peptides act differently in preventing oxidation and can be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, compared with animal-based antioxidants, plant-based compounds are more practical in the food industry. Even though plant-based antioxidant compounds are good sources of antioxidants, animal-based peptides (individual peptides) cannot be considered antioxidant compounds to add to food.
